   <p>The determination between starting with a layout or starting with a theme can be a tough one for CS level designers. Many of us are more visual people who are excited by the idea of a specific setting. Still others of us would rather attempt to create a layout that promotes new gameplay strategies or focuses on fine tuned balance. The decision over what should be prioritized is debated regularly within the community, and for the most part both sides make sense. It's really just a matter of timing.</p>

   <p>It's a fact that dedicated players often say that visual features aren't worth a trade off in how the level plays or performs. It's also true that maps that don't meet a certain level of visual polish rarely get significant attention. At the end of the day both strong gameplay and visuals are necessary components for success. However when done incorrectly these goals can conflict with one another.</p>

   <p>For example, De_Facade, the last map <a href="pesuedo code link" target="_blank">TopHATTwaffle</a> and I made, was laid out without any significant theme in mind. The focus was to create an experience that played well before spending any time being concerned with the setting. After completing the layout we decided to use a theme that dovetailed nicely with existing CS:GO maps. However the decision to blend in backfired, and was ultimately perceived as bland design. Despite a high level of graphical detail and polish the harshest criticisms facade received were in regards to it's visuals. This feedback lends some validity to the argument that visuals do matter, even in a case where gameplay was put first.</p>

   <p>Note that while the theme may have been lackluster, the map still fared well among it's competition. I believe this was mostly due to the well implemented layout. People enjoyed playing on it, so it wasn't a huge deal that it wasn't visually exciting. Had we shifted our efforts into nicer visuals instead of layout, the map would likely not have gotten much traction in the workshop. Players will show up for a pretty product, they'll eventually move on but if it doesn't play well also. In this way gameplay is more important.</p>

   <p>In an inverse example, the theme for our new map, De Titan, was always meant to be a Titan II missile base. We knew from the beginning that there was going to be a 007 esque bombsite that was situated inside a missile silo. We knew there would be concrete walls, round metal tunnels, and a control room. The theme was established first, and we looked for ways to build components of that theme into the layout as it was being conceived. However we always kept in mind that a given visual element should only exist if it wouldn't affect gameplay.
   </p>

   <p>The real world titan II missile complexes were built underground. So naturally our first draft took take place completely indoors. However when we playtested the original layout, it was painfully obvious that the map being entirely indoors wasn't going to work. Sticking with the theme wasn't worth hurting gameplay so we ended up deleting over half of the level and starting over.</p>

   <p>Gameplay was working again, but after such drastic changes our theme no longer made sense. We needed to make modifications to our aesthetic story to serve the ideal gameplay. Since the map would now need to be set partially outdoors, we improvised that the complex might be built into a the side of mountain, and relocated certain areas that were previously underground to cliffsides.</p>

   <p>While having an idea of the theme we wanted to go for was useful for creating a general shape the layout might be, it ultimately had to be secondary to gameplay. In this case, the modification to our visual narrative had the added benefit of making the finished product significantly more interesting. Had we tried to force the layout to fit into the original theme the gameplay ultimately would have suffered and the map as a whole would have failed.</p>

   <p>It's completely fine to have an idea of a setting in mind when designing a layout, but the gameplay is best served by not letting that theme interfere with the design. A strong level needs strong gameplay, and a theme won't stand on its own without well implemented gameplay. Attempting to create a layout specifically to fit a theme will likely end up with a layout that isn't working. Additionally, correcting issues like this after already investing time in artwork means being forced to either scrap completed assets, or worse, make patches in order to keep the finished work (this never works out).</p>

   <p>Visuals and gameplay are both vital to building a successful map. Whether a map is started by building a layout, or with a great idea for a theme, it will likely be ignored if it isn't both fun to play and visually interesting. The most important concept of building a map that accomplishes both of these goals is understanding at what stage to prioritize each component of the level. While a theme can help inform a layout, the layout must be refined before visual elements are implemented.</p>

   <p>I want to take an aside here at the end to write about an issue I see come up a lot in the CS:GO community. I think in a lot of ways this issue adds unnecessary pressure to the decision I'm covering in this entry.</p>

   <p>There exists a misconception that a level which looks too detailed was probably created without performance, or gameplay, in mind. This is perhaps due to a perception that a level with significant detail and polish will take a performance hit in order to render the visuals. Maybe it's the thought that a designer who spends significant time on visuals has neglected tuning gameplay in order to do so. I see these complaints levied at community levels all the time, and it really bugs me.</p>

   <p>If you look at Valve's own maps, such as the updated de_nuke, de_train, or de_inferno, you can easily see a high level of graphical detail. Yet these maps are widely accepted to be up to community standards in terms of both performance and competitive gameplay. While it makes sense for players to become frustrated when they perceive a trade off between gameplay and visuals, this perception isn't normally the reality.</p>

   <p>Building a competitive level is a labor of love. It takes hundreds and sometimes thousands of hours to complete one. It also takes a diverse skill set ranging from designing a competitive layout to texture design to model creation. Generally level designers learn all of these skills by teaching themselves. In a studio setting these skills are often broken up into individual positions, whereas these level designers are responsible for the whole range. The type of person who builds a CS level just wants to build the best thing they can. They aren't trying to short change one part of a level to fool players or rip them off. It should go without saying, but levels that play well and look gorgeous do exist. There is only a small community of people who are making them, but those people pour themselves into their craft. They deserve a chance for their work to be enjoyed.</p><br>
