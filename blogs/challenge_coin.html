   <div class="blog_post_para_heading">Step 1: Research</div>

   <p>So it turns out that valve didn’t invent the idea of a challenge coin (I’d never heard of them outside of CS) and since the things are already around there must be options to have them made right? Well, kinda… </p>

   <p>Challenge coins, when they’re generally made, are handed out to a group of anywhere from 20 to 1000 people. I only needed two, and unfortunately that would be an issue. As you may have guessed the bulk option is basically built into the manufacturing cost of challenge coins. It would have cost me somewhere around 350 bucks to get a short run of two very basic coins made. It would probably be more if I wanted them customized to match their digital counterparts. So ordering them was out of the question. I was going to have to do it myself. </p>
   <p>
      I spent a good while researching what to do next. Basically everything I found was going to require huge upfront expense like a 150 dollar furnace for trying to cast the part from metal. I was pretty sure the project was out of my reach until I started looking into cold casting. Basically cold casting is a way of combining mold resin with metal powder such that the casted part comes out looking and feeling like metal despite being 50 percent resin. Using this method I could make a master coin out of whatever materials, make a mold of it, and cold cast it with brass powder. The finished part would look just like real brass and I wouldn’t have to take up a second gig as a hitman to afford it. Neat.

   <div class="blog_post_para_heading">Step 2: Building the Master</div>
   <p>
      In order to make this coin a reality I needed to get exact references, and figure out how big I wanted it to be. After looking at what size general challenge coins are (either 1.5” or 2”) and closely examining the way the coin is presented in the game, I decided the size should be an oversized 2.5 inches in diameter. Now I just needed some good references to base my model on. “Luckily” I thought “This is a video game, so I already have the actual model just waiting to be extracted”. I was wrong.
   </p>
   <p>
      While I was correct that the model was fairly easily extracted from the games files, it was far from the gold mine I thought it would be. Once I realized what I was looking at it was clear I hadn’t been thinking very hard.  If you don’t know much about how video games are made this may come as a bit of a surprise to you, but the majority of what you see on screen basically amount to sophisticated digital parlor tricks. Instead of having actual geometrical shapes, the large majority of the details of the coin seen in game were built into the textures of the model. That meant that all of the lettering, the little stars, and the slight well that everything sits in amounted to pretty drawings on a plastic transparency. Technically this was the best way to build a model of this kind for a video game, but it was the worst case scenario if you wanted to, say, 3d print the thing. I was going to have to recreate all of those details myself. 
   </p>
   <p>
      After a good few hours of modeling in 3ds Max I had the coin. At least the coin as it was in the game. Thats is an important distinction because the coin in the game doesn’t have a back side.
      You never see it in the game so it never had a reason to exist. Fun right? Not a huge deal. Now I have total creative freedom to design whatever I want. This actually gave me the opportunity to include our names, and the year of the operation, both features I’m glad I was able to pack in. With some help from my girlfriend I teased out a decent design for the back of the coin in illustrator. I decided not to model this part because the details were just too fine to be 3d printed in my budget. Instead I opted to laser cut this part out of acrylic and simply slot it into the back of the 3d printed part. You may notice something odd about the design of the back of the coin that I’ll talk more about later.
   </p>
   <p>
      With all of the design work finally completed I ordered the parts and started to wait…
   </p>
   <p>
      And I got bored.
   </p>
   <p>
      So I started planning other features to make this coin as badass as possible. Namely the box.
   </p>

   <div><img style="width:100%;margin-bottom:-10px;margin-top:40px;" src="pesuedo code image link"></div>
   <div class="blog_post_para_heading">Step 3: The Box </div>

   <p>
      I wanted to create a box just like the one that the coin used to sit in when you inspected it in game. The good news is that you can actually buy boxes like that one for real world challenge coins. The bad news is that my coin is bigger than... challenge coins in general so none of them had an insert that would fit it. Solution? Buy one anyway and make my own insert. It would be more work, but this would alow me to get closer to the look of the one in game anyway.
   </p>
   <p>
      The box in game doesn’t actually have an insert. Instead the coin just sits up on a small leather stand. Since there wouldn’t be a pocket for the coin to sit into there would be a large cavity below the platform that the coin sits on. I decided to utilize this space as an storage area for the leather stand to fold up and slot into. This way when I gave my partner his it would all be enclosed neatly in one case. I made the leather stand with a bit of thin faux leather made for use with a desktop die cutting machine, some plastic from a crappy plastic folder, and a couple of magnets to hold it in place for use. There was enough remaining space in that cavity for something else to fit as well, but like the design of the back of the coin I’ll tell you about that later. 
   </p>
   <p>
      The insert itself was made from poster board with a nice white fabric stuck to it with spray glue. I traced out the shape of the inside of the box and measured the its depth so that I could draw out a template for the bottom compartments. After a few attempts I got a shape that would fold up into a piece that fit perfectly and provided a small lip for the top platform to sit on. To make the lid I cut a plate from thin sheet metal with tin snips and wrapped it in the same white fabric. I also added a little pull tab in the front to open the lid up with.
   </p>
   <p>
      The case in the game also had these small brass circles on the front and a brass clasp on the bottom. After a bit of looking I decided that using brass brads would work for the circle details. I couldn’t find a clasp like the one in game anywhere online so I made fake hardware by cutting and bending a bit of brass sheeting. These details all came out looking pretty nice in my opinion.
      Not bad for a few afternoons work.
   </p>

   <div class="blog_post_para_heading">Step 4: Molding and Casting</div>

   <p>
      With all of my molding and casting supplies as well as the parts for my master having arrived it was finally time make these things. First I have to say that the 3d print I ordered came out almost exactly like the model I sent in. The layer lines were incredibly small and the lettering was perfect. I was pretty blown away. The laser etching was similarly pretty badass, but I was sort of expecting that to begin with. 
   </p>
   <p>
      So really all I needed to do to “assemble” the master was to pop the laser cut disk into the back of the 3d printed part with some super glue on it. There was a small seam along the edge where the two parts met since the disc was just a bit too small. Nothing that a small bit of bondo and sanding wouldn’t fix. That blue stuff you see in on the back of the coin is just a piece of painters tape I used to cover the hole through the laser cut disk. It keeps the silicone from leaking into the inner cavity of the coin and ruining the mold. I was really geeking out at this point because I was basically holding the real deal in my hand. It was awesome to get a feeling for the size and form of the thing, and I literally slept with it on my nightstand the night I assembled it.
   </p>
   <p>
      Now that the coin was ready making the mold was simple. I made a little box with no top out of foam core and hot glue and put modeling clay around the inside of the box about up to about  halfway except for a hole in the center. Then I laid the coin flat over the clay, smashed it about halfway in, and used the back of a colored pencil to smush litle registration marks in the corners. I also added a length of the colored pencil that connected the edge of the coin to the edge of the box to create a pouring spout. The silicone I got was a simple 1:1 mix which I poured in a very small stream from very high up into a single corner of the mold to reduce bubbles. I had no room for a pressure chamber in my budget so I used any trick I could find online to get rid of air bubbles in the mold. After one side of the mold was set I removed the clay from the back and poured the other side right on top of the now cured silicone.
   </p>
   <p>
      The first mold was a complete dud. Absolutely covered in bubbles, So I tried again, this time painting a layer of the silicon into all of the crevices first, then pouring the rest in over that. Far better results with this method. I was now ready for the moment of truth. Casting
   </p>
   <p>
      You can cold cast a piece in a couple of ways. One involves brushing on a thin layer of metal powder to the inside of the mold and pouring your resin top of it. The downside to this method is that it only has a thin layer of metal which can be easily scratched off. Another method is simply to mix in the metal powder to your resin. This makes the part a lot more convincing and also uses a lot more metal powder. I wanted this thing to be as close to a real coin as possible so I opted to do both. The ideal mix of metal powder to resin is something I had trouble finding online. Basically what I got from my research was that if you go over 50% powder you’ll end up with a brittle part. I went a bit below that at 45%. 
   </p>
   <p>
      Casting was pretty straight forward as well. First I dusted the inside of my mold with some of the brass powder. The I mixed up the two part resin with the brass powder and painted a light layer of it into all of the tighter details. That done I bound the two halves of my mold together with rubber bands over foam core panels to distribute the pressure evenly and slowly poured in the rest of the mixed resin. I poured some of the leftover resin into the better half of my failed mold so that I’d have an idea of when it was set up enough to demold my part.
   </p>

   <div class="blog_post_para_heading">Step 5: Finishing</div>

   <p>
      The coins came out looking awesome, and I could see that I was in the home stretch. The only other thing I did to finish the coins themselves was lightly polish them with steel wool, give them a light wash with some black acrylic to make the details pop, and wipe them down with a jewelry polishing rag to bring out a little more shine. These things looked fantastic and I was beaming every time I saw them. They have a great weight and feel very solid. They even have that cold feeling when you pick them up like a real coin would. But wait! What about that stuff I said I’d tell you about later?! 
   </p>

   <p>
      So as a final flair of over the top detail I decided to include an additional goofy feature. The little slot in the back of the coin is there to hold a magnet. That magnet has a sibling hiding in a ribbon which folds up into the extra space in the case beside the leather stand. It’s a bit ridiculous, but it turns the coin into a nerdy olympics style medal. I love it.
   </p>

   <p>
      And with that I was done. I’m so proud of how these coins came out, and my partner was blown away when I surprised him with his. About four months after making my coin Valve announced the limited run they would be doing for 5 year veteran coins so I guess great minds and all that.
      Two coins is certainly nothing to complain about.
